Figures \ref{fig:Q19_ideal_05}, \ref{fig:Q19_ideal_06}, \ref{fig:Q19_gauss_1} and \ref{fig:Q19_gauss_1} 
illustrate image \texttt{hand256} subsampled and smoothed using a Gaussian and an ideal low-pass filter.

\subsection{Question 19}

Sub-sampling results in pixels of bigger size, hence a neighbourhood of pixels are compacted into one, and the different values of all those pixels are lost.
Hence, information is lost and shapes become coarser. Is the sub-sampling occurs at a lower frequency than the Nyquist frequency then the image's 
characteristics are distorted irrevocably.

The first thing noticed in this exercise is that there is an qualitative information loss balance: it is possible to smooth the sub-sampled images to a higher degree 
than the original images. Smoothing the original images in that degree results in information loss, just as the one introduced when sub-sampling. Since the two
filters used here are low-pass filters, we can see that the outline of the hand in the image remains fairly accurate, even a higher variances, or lower cut-off
frequencies.
