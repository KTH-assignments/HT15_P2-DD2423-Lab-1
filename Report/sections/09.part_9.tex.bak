\subsection{Question 19}

Sub-sampling results in pixels of bigger size, hence a neighbourhood of pixels are compacted into one, and the different values of all those pixels are lost.
Hence, information is lost and shapes become coarser. If the sub-sampling occurs at a lower frequency than the Nyquist frequency then the image's 
characteristics are distorted irrevocably.

The first thing noticed in this exercise is that there is an qualitative information loss balance: it is possible to smooth the sub-sampled images to a higher degree 
than the original images. Smoothing the original images in that degree results in information loss, just as the one introduced when sub-sampling. Since the two
filters used here are low-pass filters, we can see that the outline of the hand in the image remains fairly accurate, even a higher variances, or lower cut-off
frequencies.

Figure \ref{fig:Q19_N4_ideal_01} illustrates image \texttt{hand256} sub-sampled $4$ times, its smoothed variant using a Gaussian filter of variance $t=5$,
and their corresponding spectra. Figure \ref{fig:Q19_N1_gauss_5} illustrates the original \texttt{hand256} image, its smoothed variant using the same
settings as in figure \ref{fig:Q19_N4_gauss_5}, and their corresponding spectra.

Figure \ref{fig:Q19_N4_ideal_01} illustrates image \texttt{hand256} sub-sampled $4$ times, its smoothed variant using an ideal low-pass filter with
a cut-off frequency of $0.1$ cycles per pixel, and their corresponding spectra. 
Figure \ref{fig:Q19_N1_ideal_01} illustrates the original \texttt{hand256} image, its smoothed variant using the same
settings as in figure \ref{fig:Q19_N4_ideal_01}, and their corresponding spectra.

With regard to smoothing the sub-sampled versions of the original images, the same effects as in \textit{Question 17}: the Gaussian filter
introduces blurring and the ideal low-pass filter introduces ringing. The higher the resolution of the image,
the higher the level of details preserved with regard to blurring, and the coarser the ringing effect.


\subsection{Question 20}

Judging from the spectra of the $4$ figures above, it is evident that the smoothed versions of the original images contain much higher frequencies
than their sub-sampled counterparts. This is reasonable since higher resolution can capture more sensitive details, meaning much higher frequencies.
The spectra of the sub-sampled images are barely touched by the sub-sampling process with regard to these high frequencies.
